Python Project for MIPT (Technology of Programming)

## This is a simulation automata engine with implementation of sand, water and dirt 
### Install requirements.txt
### Then run "python3 main.py"


To have fun:
- in file resources/settings.py, there are WINDOW size, such as:
        "WINDOW_WIDTH = 1024 WINDOW_HEIGHT = 720"
    you can change them yourself if you want to
- in file resources/settings.py, there are CELL size, such as:
        "CELL_SIZE = 5"
        "MAX_INS_SIZE = 10"
    this sets up the minimum cell_size that can be in my game
    I highly do not recommend set it very low(like from 1 to 4) due to bad performance
